    AsyncFunction: Add tests ensuring the new 1-tick await behaviour (#1843)
    
    * AsyncFunction: Add tests ensuring the new 1-tick await behaviour
    
    This commit adds 3 tests ensuring the optimized behaviour of await
    (see https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1250) in the following cases:
    - async functions
    - yielding from async generator functions
    - for-await-of loops
    
    * AsyncFunction: Add tests ensuring the monkey-patched promises behaviour
    
    This commit adds 2 more tests ensuring the optimized behaviour of await
    (see tc39/ecma262#1250) in the following cases:
    - awaiting on a native promise with monkey-patched "then"
    - awaiting on a non-native promise (a "thenable" object)
    
    * AsyncFunction: Add tests ensuring the non-native promises behaviour
    
    This commit adds 1 more tests ensuring the optimized behaviour of await
    (see tc39/ecma262#1250) in the following cases:
    - awaiting on a non-promise, non-thenable object
    
    It also renames the previous test for non-promise (a "thenable" object)
    to distinguish from the new case.
    
    The commit adds checks for proper await/promises interleaving in the
    aforementioned cases and includes a small code clean-up.
    
    * AsyncFunction: Refactor tests ensuring the new 1-tick await behaviour
    
    Gather all the tests to their appropriate folder and update copyright header.
